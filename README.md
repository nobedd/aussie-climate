# Welcome to Aussie Climate
Aussie Climate is a D3 data visualisation project that visualises the average temperature and rainfall of Australia for the last 100 years.

The rainfall/temperature data is visualised using a basic chropleth map of Australia, each circle represents an observation site, and is colour coded according to its average temperature/rainfall reading on the year value of the range slider. Each state is colour coded according to the mean readings of observation sites within the state.

# Welcome to Aussie Climate
Aussie Climate is a D3 data visualisation project that visualises the average temperature and rainfall of Australia for the last 100 years.

The rainfall/temperature data is visualised with a simple choropleth map of Australia, each circle on the map represents an observation site, and is colour coded according to its yearly mean temperature/rainfall reading. Each state is colour coded according to the yearly mean temperature/rainfall readings of observation sites within the state.
